### cm007 2017-09-26 Tuesday overview

#### Housekeeping

- Your peer reviews for Homework 01 should have been submitted by last night.
- Homework 02 due today by midnight. Peer review to be posted soon after. 
- Homework 03 has been posted. Check the syllabus page.
- Might be missing 4 (probably more) people on Slack. Email me to ask for an invitation. There are announcements and helpful advice that goes on there.

#### Today

- Today we complete our introduction to `ggplot2`.
    - We'll get through as much as we can from Jenny's [`ggplot2` tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial).
    - Whatever we don't cover, remains as a resource you can draw on in future.

#### Resources

- The [Data visualisation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) chapter in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) is an excellent brief introduction to ggplot2.
