#### Slides and links

*will link later if I show slides*

#### For R novices

You should have finished working through these by now:

  * [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects](block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html)
  * [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](block004_basic-r-objects.html)
  * [Basic care and feeding of data in R](block006_care-feeding-data.html)

#### Did anyone work with `swirl`?

I want to check in on people who looked at [swirl](http://swirlstats.com).

#### `ggplot2` links

All of this will be eventually ported over into STAT545 materials but will go ahead and link now.

  * A `ggplot2` [tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial) I taught May 2013
