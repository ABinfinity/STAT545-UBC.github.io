### Overview

@jennybc: TODO for me. Might link to slides? Or just an HTML page?

  * Why make an R package?
  * What is an R package?
  * What is a library?
  * Why `devtools` is so integral to a happy workflow.

### Prepare your system for package development

[System prep and testing](packages01_system-prep.html)

Although we'll build a very simple package, we're still going to use the most modern and powerful tools for R package development. In theory, this could eventually involve compiling C/C++ code, which means you need what's called a "build environment." Follow the link above for help preparing your system.
