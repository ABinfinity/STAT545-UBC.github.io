### cm001 2014-09-03 Wednesday overview

  * Introduction to the course *slides to be posted after class*
  * Students to do for Monday 2014-09-08 (see below)
    - install software
    - sign up for accounts
  * Don't panic if there are glitches. That's normal.
  * What's coming? We'll help you begin to use all your new toys next week!

#### Git

For now, follow the "install Git" instructions from this recent Software Carpentry Bootcamp I led: <http://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/setup.html>

  * Windows: <http://msysgit.github.io>  
  * Mac:
  * Linux:

#### R and RStudio

Follow [these instructions](../../block000_r-rstudio-install.html). Stick with it to the bitter end, where you try to get Git and RStudio talking to each other.

If you have some ancient version or R and/or RStudio, just go ahead and update! It often requires more technical skill to function with old software (and hardware).

#### Twitter

<https://twitter.com>  

I will use the [\@STAT545](https://twitter.com/STAT545) Twitter account to make micro-announcements, share interesting links, and facilitate a conversation amongst ourselves __in public__.

In class, we'll talk about Twitter, its scholarly use, and privacy. Some relevant links:

  * [Disposable Twitter Accounts for Classroom Use](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/disposable-twitter-accounts-for-classroom-use/40145) from ProfHacker on the Chronicle of Higher Education
    -  Good quote: "I strongly encourage you to create a disposable account if for any reason you prefer not to share your personal account for classroom activities."
  * [Resources for exploring digital identity, privacy and authenticity](http://catherinecronin.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/525/) from Catherine Cronin
  * [Some advice to young graduate students](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/advice-to-graduate-students.html) from C. Titus Brown
  * [How to be the grad student your advisor brags about](http://blog.impactstory.org/how-to-be-the-grad-student-your-advisor-brags-about/) from the blog of Impactstory
  * [10 Commandments of Twitter for Academics](http://chronicle.com/article/10-Commandments-of-Twitter-for/131813/) from Do Your Job Better on the Chronicle of Higher Education
  * [Using Twitter in university research, teaching and
impact activities: A guide for academics and researchers (PDF)](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/files/2011/11/Published-Twitter_Guide_Sept_2011.pdf)

If you choose not get a Twitter account, you will want to visit the [\@STAT545 profile page](https://twitter.com/STAT545) regularly to see what's up.

If you set up (or already have a Twitter account), you should follow [\@STAT545](https://twitter.com/STAT545).

#### GitHub

  * Register for a free individual GitHub account and request [the student discount](https://education.github.com). This should give you some free private repositories for a couple of years. Do this ASAP! I think a human vets these requests, so it could take a couple of days.
    - As with Twitter, think before you set up your public profile. I suggest you use a real name and begin to build a scholarly identity in social media and coding, but it's a decision you should make with intention.
  
#### Git(Hub) client

Learning how and why to use version control can be rough at first. I certainly found the use of a GUI -- as opposed to the command line -- extremely helpful when I was getting started.

As mentioned above, __RStudio__ has a basic front-end for Git(Hub). I use this more and more for quick, simple operations.

[SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com) is a free, much more powerful Git(Hub) client that I highly recommend. It was my first Git GUI and is still my favorite for nontrivial Git tasks.

GitHub itself offers clients: [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com) and [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com). I have friends and family using this and they are happy with it.

Fair warning: for some things, you will have to use the command line.

#### RPubs

<http://rpubs.com>

This is a free hosting service provided by RStudio. It is the fastest way to get a report up on the web, based on an R script or an R Markdown file. We may use this a little before we move on to other techniques. Best to go ahead and register for a free account.
