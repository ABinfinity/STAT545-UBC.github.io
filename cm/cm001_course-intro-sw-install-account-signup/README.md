### cm001 2014-09-03 Wednesday overview

  * Introduction to the course
  * TO DO: install software
  * TO DO: sign up for accounts

#### Git

For now, follow the "install Git" instructions from this recent Software Carpentry Bootcamp I led: <http://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/setup.html>

  * Windows: <http://msysgit.github.io>  
  * Mac:
  * Linux:

#### R and RStudio

Follow these instructions from a recent SWC Bootcamp I led:

<http://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/r-setup.html>

Follow to the bitter end, where you try to get Git and RStudio talking to each other.

#### Twitter

<https://twitter.com>  

Instructor will use the [\@STAT545](https://twitter.com/STAT545) Twitter account to make micro-announcements, share interesting links, and facilitate a conversation amongst ourselves __in public__.

In class, we'll talk about Twitter, its scholarly use, and privacy. Some relevant links:

  * [Disposable Twitter Accounts for Classroom Use](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/disposable-twitter-accounts-for-classroom-use/40145) from ProfHacker on the Chronicle of Higher Education
    -  Good quote: "I strongly encourage you to create a disposable account if for any reason you prefer not to share your personal account for classroom activities."
  * [Resources for exploring digital identity, privacy and authenticity](http://catherinecronin.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/525/) from Catherine Cronin
  * [Some advice to young graduate students](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/advice-to-graduate-students.html) from C. Titus Brown
  * [How to be the grad student your advisor brags about](http://blog.impactstory.org/how-to-be-the-grad-student-your-advisor-brags-about/) from the blog of Impactstory
  * [10 Commandments of Twitter for Academics](http://chronicle.com/article/10-Commandments-of-Twitter-for/131813/) from Do Your Job Better on the Chronicle of Higher Education
  * [Using Twitter in university research, teaching and
impact activities: A guide for academics and researchers (PDF)](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/files/2011/11/Published-Twitter_Guide_Sept_2011.pdf)

If you choose not get a Twitter account, you will want to visit the [\@STAT545 profile page](https://twitter.com/STAT545) regularly to see what's up.

If you set up (or already have a Twitter account), you should follow [\@STAT545](https://twitter.com/STAT545).

#### GitHub

  * Register an [educational GitHub account](https://education.github.com); it has the added perk of giving you some free private repositories for a couple of years. You probably want a *student, individual* account.
  * Optional: Upload your photo to [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com), if you're comfortable with that. This photo will appear in your GitHub profile, be associated with your commits and comments, etc. Consider using the same photo for Twitter.

#### RPubs
