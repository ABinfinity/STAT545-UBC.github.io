### cm002 2017-09-07 Thursday overview

Since last time: 

- you should at least have R and RStudio installed.

Today:

- Housekeeping: changes to website:
    - office hours
    - cm's changed to three parts: `Since last time`, `Today`, and `To do before next class`.
- Introduction to R and RStudio. Live coding about [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects](block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html).

To do before next class:

- R/RStudio novices: finish the activity (linked below)
- experienced useRs: maybe check out [swirl](http://swirlstats.com) (more below)
- any other R learning exercises you wish ...
- everyone: try to get your Git and GitHub setup done: Follow the "Installation" section of Happy Git book <http://happygitwithr.com/installation-pain.html>.

* What's next?
    - We elicit your name, GitHub username ... will email you link to a web form (done w/ Shiny and R, naturally!)
    - Tuesday: more R, test drive Git(Hub), compiling an R script or R markdown document to HTML
    - First homework will be due ... probably before class Tuesday September 20. See the [2015 version here]() (some changes still coming).

Resources to take a look at:

- Google's [R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml).
- Jenny Bryan's [deep thoughts about data analytic work](https://www.slideshare.net/jenniferbryan5811/cm002-deep-thoughts), and related links:
  * Jack Handey's Deep Thoughts were a Saturday Night Live thing, many moons ago
  * [Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS)](http://ess.r-project.org) manual. ESS + Emacs is still a great way to work with R, especially if you want one editor/IDE to cover other (non-R) languages. I used ESS before eventually switching to RStudio. Still waiting for the [Emacs key-bindings](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/communities/public/questions/200757977-Emacs-key-bindings-again-) :(
  * Vince Buffalo [tweet](https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/358699162679787521) re: "write code for humans, write data for computers". Apparently he also uses the phrase in his new book [Bioinformatics Data Skills](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do).
  * [Tweet](https://twitter.com/jiffyclub/status/508761376488030208) by `@jiffyclub` illustrating agony of working with data formatted for human eyeballs
    - his [iPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/abostroem/2014-09-10-LBL/blob/master/pandas/load_precip_data.ipynb)
    - [data](http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/reports/PRECIPOUT.2011) he was working with from California's Department of Water Resources Data Exchange Center

  * [swirl](http://swirlstats.com): "a software package for the R programming language that turns the R console into an interactive learning environment"

#### For R novices

Work through: [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects](block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html) if we don't finish in class.

#### For those familiar with R

Check out [swirl](http://swirlstats.com). Work through one or more interactive courses with the goal of writing a short review (include in homework?). Feeling more ambitious? Check out [`swirlify`](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/) and [create a new lesson](http://swirlstats.com/instructors.html). I'd be happy to help think up topics.
