### cm006 2014-09-22 Monday overview

  * HW01 and associated peer review has been processed; expect feedback in next ~day
  * You've seen and done all the mechanics now: Git(Hub), R Markdown, HW submission, peer review, Discussion, etc.
    - Questions? Comments?
    - FYI: We have our own apps working now, on our own server, so peer marks will be submitted that way from now on (instead of via Google form).
  * Complete our introduction to `ggplot2`
  * What's next?
    - Wed we'll begin data wrangling and aggregation with `dplyr`
    - [HW 3](hw03_???.html) due before class Monday 2014-09-29. It will be making more figures, more sophisticated than last week, and more explorations/summaries of data. Probably Gapminder, though you can ask for approval to use something else. Will cover `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.    
    
#### Slides and links

*Slides will be made available if we use any*

Links and notes related to the slides

#### `ggplot2` links

  * A `ggplot2` [tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial) I taught May 2013 contains lots of working code, in source form and compiled to something pretty
    - [ggplot2 online docs](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)
    - [ggplot2 "homepage"](http://ggplot2.org)
    - [ggplot2 development on github](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2) 
    - [The R Graphics Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do), an excellent book by Winston Chang.
    - The [graphs section](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) of Winston Chang's website Cookbook for R. The book listed above contains much more material, but the website is good too.
    - [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0387981403/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=ggplot2-20) by Hadley Wickham. [Book's companion website](http://ggplot2.org/book/) offers one R script per chapter, providing the code used in the book.
    - [A quick introduction to ggplot2](http://inundata.org/2013/04/10/a-quick-introduction-to-ggplot2/) by Karthik Ram. Slides and code from a 2 hour talk/hands on presentation for ggplot2 beginners.
