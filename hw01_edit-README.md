### Overview

Consult the [general homework guidelines](hw00_homework-guidelines.html), although much does not to apply to this simple assignment.

Recall the [tutorial](git07_git-github-rstudio.html) where we test drive your software installation and account configuration.

[Take possession of your STAT 545 private repository](git08_claim-stat545-repo.html).

Due before class Tuesday 2014-09-22. Or later that day, if terrible things happen, and you need a consultation during class or office hours. This is the last time we'll flex on due date just because of software and configuration issues. SORT THIS OUT ASAP.

The goal is to test your software installation, our GitHub setup, and our homework submission process via an Issue.

  * Honestly, the above is the only reason this homework even exists.

### Edit `README.md`

We created this repository for you but it is empty. When you first visit, you should see a screen like [this](img/screenshot-empty-repo.png). You need to create a `README.md` file to welcome your visitors (you, STAT545 instructor/TAs, STAT545 peers).

If you are already familiar with GitHub, edit the `README.md` any way you wish.

If you are new to Git and GitHub, click on the `README` link in "We recommend every repository include a README ..." and you will be able to edit `README.md` in the browser and make your first commit. If you are still mystified by Git(Hub), you can use this browser-based method to edit `README.md` until you get more comfortable with using Git locally and pushing to GitHub. __However, if at all possible__, we want you to practice this workflow:

  - pull from GitHub (just an empty precaution now, but will matter when you collaborate with others)
  - make changes locally to local files
  - save your changes
  - commit your changes to your repo
  - push the commit to GitHub

__At the very least__, change `README.md` to something like "This is the repository of Jenny Bryan," just to prove you have been there. Practice making a link, for example, to the [main STAT545 webpage](http://stat545-ubc.github.io). Much better is to introduce yourself to the class; this page is private to STAT 545 but will be visible to all students and staff. Feel free to read up on Markdown and practice with some of the syntax. Here's a [simple example file](https://github.com/jennybc/2013-11_sfu/blob/master/simple-markdown.md), as automatically rendered by GitHub, and here is the [raw source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/2013-11_sfu/master/simple-markdown.md).

### Report your process

Include a description of how you got the changes into `README.md` on GitHub.

  * Did you edit in the browser at github.com?
  * Did you pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com?

You're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.

### Submit the assignment

Follow instructions on [How to submit homework](hw00_homework-guidelines.html#how-to-submit-homework)

### Rubric

Check minus: `README.md` says equivalent of "This is the repository of Jenny Bryan". All work done via browser at github.com ... but that's just a guess, because student doesn't actually say how it was done.

Check: something in between

Check plus: `README.md` provides a proper introduction of student to the class. It also demonstrates experimentation with 4 or more aspects of the Markdown syntax. Examples: section headers, links, bold, italic, bullet points, image embed, etc. The student describes how they got the changes into `README.md` and offers a few reflections on their GitHub workflow and their experience with Markdown.
