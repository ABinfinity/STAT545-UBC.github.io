# Syllabus





In early September 2016, this reflects what happened in 2015. As the semester unfolds, we update with 2016 plans and reality. Overview:

  * STAT 545 = 7 weeks
  * STAT 547 = 6 weeks
  * First 7 + 2 = 9 weeks is general data wrangling, exploration, analysis
  * Last 4 weeks = 4 one-week self-contained intermediate topics (order likely to change):
    - Build your first R package
    - Build a Shiny app
    - Get data from the web (scraping and APIs)
    - Automate tasks and pipelines

<!-- unholy hack to make following two tables less wide and the same wide -->

   max-width: 50%;
}
</style>

#### STAT 545A (2015 plan ... gradually overwritten by 2016)
