### cm008 2014-10-01 Wednesday overview

  * HW04 will be due before class Monday 2014-10-06. Will be to write a function, documenting process from interactive pilot to formal tests. Polishing today's last example will be the easiest option, but you could do something else. Apply function to Gapminder using `plyr`. Watch Twitter.
  * Writing your own functions! The exciting conclusion
    - [Write your own R functions, part 1](block011_write-your-own-function-01.html) *done Monday*
    - [Write your own R functions, part 2](block011_write-your-own-function-02.html) *done Monday*
    - [Write your own R functions, part 3](block011_write-your-own-function-03.html) *TODAY*
    - reminder: dustin quantile names thing
  * Data aggregation
    - [Slides](http://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/slides/session07_dataAggregation.pdf)
    - Guided challenge: write function to regress life expectancy on year and return the estimate intercept and slope
    - Use `plyr::ddply()` to apply this function to all countries in Gapminder
