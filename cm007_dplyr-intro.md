### cm007 2014-09-24 Wednesday overview

  * HW01 and associated peer review has been processed; you should have gotten an email from us
  * HW02 peer review will be set in motion today; you'll review the work of 2 peers
  * Introduction to `dplyr`
  * What's next? I'll select from these topics
    - Functions
    - Tidy data
    - More data aggregation with, e.g., `plyr`
    - [HW 3](hw03_dplyr-and-more.html) (ROUGH DRAFT) due before class Monday 2014-09-29. It will be making more figures, more sophisticated than last week, and more explorations/summaries of data. Probably Gapminder, though you can ask for approval to use something else. Will cover `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.    
    
#### Slides and links

*there were no slides*

#### `dplyr`

I've written two hands-on guides:

  * [Introduction to dplyr](block009_dplyr-intro.html)
  * [`dplyr` functions for a single dataset](block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html)
  * See the resources at the bottom of those two pages for excellent links. There are actually many good introductory tutorials for `dplyr`. I think it inspires people!
