  * Introduction to `dplyr`
  * What's next? I'll select from these topics
    - Functions
    - Tidy data
    - More data aggregation with, e.g., `plyr`
    
#### Slides and links

*there were no slides*

#### `dplyr`

I've written two hands-on guides:

  * [Introduction to dplyr](block009_dplyr-intro.html)
  * [`dplyr` functions for a single dataset](block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html)
  * See the resources at the bottom of those two pages for excellent links. There are actually many good introductory tutorials for `dplyr`. I think it inspires people!
