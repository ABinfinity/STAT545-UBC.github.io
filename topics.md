# Topics

All course content will be indexed here, *sans* course-related minutiae like homework due dates.

Until we get rolling, feel free to look at older material that will appear here in updated form:

  * [Clean index](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/quick-index.html) into topics covered in 2013
  * [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A_2013) for 2013 course materials
  
### Updated topics

  * [Install Git and more](block001_git-install.html)
  * [Install R and Rstudio](block000_r-rstudio-install.html)
  * [Git configuration and credential caching](block003_git-config-credential-cache.html)
  * [Basic R and RStudio, workspace, working directory, RStudio Project](block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html)
  * [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](block004_basic-r-objects.html)
  
### Course material

  * [Class meeting 001](cm001_course-intro-sw-install-account-signup.html) deals with "What is data science? What is data carpentry?" and includes links re: use of Twitter in academia.
  * [Class meeting 002](cm002_r-rstudio-intro.html) provides some Deep Thoughts about data analytic work, then shifts into a hands-on intro to R and RStudio.
  * [Class meeting 003](cm003_r-objects-git-toe-dip.html) Started basic flavors of R objects; Git(Hub) and (R) Markdown crash course so first HW0 can be submitted. All hands-on.

### Short random things

  * [Lesson I contributed](bit002_tidying-lotr-data.html) to [Data Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/05/our-first-data-carpentry-workshop.html) on tidying data
  * [Cheatsheet](bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html) for `dplyr` join functions

### What's coming

Topics traditionally covered in STAT 545A, with light updating:

  * ~~Introduction to R and the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)~~ *done*
  * ~~R scripts and workspaces, RStudio Projects; how to get your work done~~ *done*
  * Creating reports from R scripts and [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), using [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr/)
  * ~~Deep thoughts about data analytic work~~ *done*
  * Care and feeding of data in R; data frames
  * R objects -- beyond data frames
  * Indexing, subsetting
  * Data aggregation; "apply" functions, [`plyr`](http://plyr.had.co.nz), [`dplyr`](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr)
  * How to help yourself, how to ask questions to get useful answers
  * How to get data in and out of R, staying as "open" as possible
  * How to get figures out of R
  * Be the boss of your factors, i.e. categorical variables
  * Use of color in R
  * Single quantitative variable: visualizations and descriptive statistics
  * Two quantitative variables: visualizations and descriptive statistics
  * Categorical variables: visualizations and descriptive statistics
  * Multivariate visualizations
  * Visualizing and summarizing data when "grouped"
  * Coding style and project organization
  
New topics for STAT 545A and/or STAT 547M will be selected from here:

  * Bash shell / unix basics, personal system administration.
  * Version control with Git, collaboration via [GitHub](https://github.com)
  * The tabular data mentality, "tidy" data, data reshaping
  * Regular expressions, programmatic transformation and searching of character data
  * Writing R functions
  * `ggplot2` will be used instead of `lattice` for visualization
  * Creating interactive pages, apps, and graphics via [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) and (maybe) [`ggvis`](http://ggvis.rstudio.com)
  * Unit testing, at least as a mentality. Maybe will cover formal unit testing, e.g. `testthat`
  * Stats particularly useful in exploration (and often neglected in standard intro stats courses)
    - robust summary statistics
    - robust regression
    - smoothing
    - density estimation
    - cluster analysis, PCA, SVD, MDS
  * Embrace the web:
    - getting data from the web, e.g. using an API or via scraping
    - exposing your hard work on the web (data, code, results)
  * Distributing data and code to the world via an R package
  * Automating an analytical pipeline, e.g. via `Make`.
